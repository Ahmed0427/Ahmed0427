### Ahmed

Just another sleep-deprived code monkey pretending caffeine is a personality trait. I build “disruptive” apps that no one asked for and sometimes reinvent wheels, because why not? I write Go and C like it’s the ‘90s—because remember when memory management was a daily trauma and debugging meant staring at code until it blinked first. I use nvim btw. Linux is my home—if it doesn’t run on Linux, it’s either garbage or some corporate nonsense and I’m not interested.

### Currently Learning

- **Quantum JavaScript** — where `0 == 1` if you believe hard enough.
- **Writing an OS in Brainfuck** — because I enjoy suffering *and* confusing compilers.
- **Rendering 3D graphics in Bash** — 1 FPS of pure, unfiltered regret.
- **Building a blockchain for tracking my caffeine intake** — immutable proof of poor life choices.
- **Reverse engineering my casio calculator to mine crypto** — passive income.
- **Getting Arch Linux to boot from a potato** — spoiler: it *can*, but you shouldn't.
