## Ahmed

Sleep-deprived CS student powered by caffeine and bad decisions. Builds apps no one asked for. Reinvents wheels, badly. Writes Go for fun, C for pain. Likes command-line tools, terminal-based workflows, and Neovim.

## Currently Learning

- **Quantum JavaScript**, where `0 == 1` if you believe hard enough.
- **OS in Excel formulas**, bootloader in `=IF(A1="BIOS",TRUE,FALSE)`.  
- **Rendering 3D graphics in Bash**, 1 FPS of pure, unfiltered regret.
- **Building a blockchain for tracking my caffeine intake**, immutable proof of poor life choices.
- **Reverse engineering my casio calculator to mine crypto**, passive income bro.
- **Getting Arch Linux to boot from a potato**, spoiler: it *can*, but you shouldn't.
