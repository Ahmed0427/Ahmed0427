Sleep? Overrated. I'm just another caffeine-powered CS student. Builds apps no one asked for and sometimes reinvent wheels. badly. I write Go and C because who doesn’t love babysitting pointers for fun? I use nvim, because real programmers fear the mouse. The terminal is my home, and I only leave to get coffee... and even then, I run `ssh terminal.shop`

## Currently Learning

- **Quantum JavaScript** — where `0 == 1` if you believe hard enough.
- **OS in Excel formulas** — bootloader in `=IF(A1="BIOS",TRUE,FALSE)`.  
- **Rendering 3D graphics in Bash** — 1 FPS of pure, unfiltered regret.
- **Building a blockchain for tracking my caffeine intake** — immutable proof of poor life choices.
- **Reverse engineering my casio calculator to mine crypto** — passive income.
- **Getting Arch Linux to boot from a potato** — spoiler: it *can*, but you shouldn't.
